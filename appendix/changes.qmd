## 2024-2025

Starting this year, the Department changed 643/6430 from a required PhD course 
to an elective PhD course.

The university started using Workday as the underlying system for student 
records. 
This resulted in the following changes:

- Course Renumbering
- Wording Updates
- Process Changes


### Course Renumbering

All courses at the university were converted from 3 digits to 4 digits by 
adding a 0 to the end of the course number, e.g. STAT 542 is now STAT 5420. 
It is expected that the Department will have a mass renumbering of courses soon
to take advantage of the 4 digit numbers.

### Wording Updates

Many of the terms used in graduate education at ISU have changed. 
Perhaps the two most important are 

- Program of Study (POS) -> Academic Plan (AP)
- Program of Study Committee (POSC) -> Academic Plan Committee (APC)

### Process Changes

Essentially all student processes, e.g. registration, payroll, etc, 
are now in Workday. 

## 2018

In 2018, the university changed a rule that resulted in courses intended for
graduate students outside Statistics to be renumbered from a 400-level course
to a 500-level course. 
The result of this is that there are many 500-level (now 5000-level) courses
that CANNOT be used for the Statistics MS and PhD degrees.
These courses include the following statement:

> May not be used for graduate credit in the Statistics MS and PhD degree programs.
