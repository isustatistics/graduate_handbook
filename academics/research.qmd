Required courses provide the necessary background to enroll in elective courses.
Elective courses provide the necessary background to initiate research. 
Ultimately, the primary purpose of a PhD program is train students in the 
developing their capacity to perform research. 

There are a variety of different types of research within the Department of 
Statistics including theoretical, computational, applied, etc. 
Ultimately, it is (statistical) research if it can be published within the
