# Progress

Continued membership in the Statistics MS or PhD program and financial support 
are contingent upon Satisfactory Academic Progress towards the degree.  

Satisfactory Academic Progress entails 

- Maintaining a 3.0 Cumulative GPA

and completing a series of requirements in a timely manner.
These requirements include

- Successfully Completing Courses
- Passing Qualifying Exams
- Finding a Major Professor
- Creating an Academic Plan Committee
- Developing an Academic Plan
- Passing a Preliminary Exam
- Writing a Creative Component or Dissertation
- Passing a Final Exam

At the end of every academic year each student will document their own progress 
by preparing a brief annual report of their coursework, 
research work in progress, exams, POS meetings, future goals, 
timeline for degree completion, professional activities, 
and provide an up-to-date curriculum vitae. 

Modifications to these requirements requires approval of the DOGE. 

## Maintaining a 3.0 Cumulative GPA

Under [Chapter 5 - Courses, Credits, and Grading](https://www.grad-college.iastate.edu/handbook/chapter5-coursework)
in the Graduate Handbook, 
see the Probation and Academic Standing section.


## Successfully Completing Courses

The timelines provided for each degree provide the semesters when courses are
expected to be taken. 
The minimum grade acceptable for a course on the Academic Plan is a C. 
Thus, Successfully Completing Courses means to enroll and complete the courses
in the timelines given and receive a minimum of a C.


## Passing Qualifying Exams

The Department of Statistics has qualifying exams for its MS and PhD degrees. 
These are generally in-class exams given during summer break. 
The MS qualifying exam is taken after Year 1 and the PhD qualifying exam is 
taken after Year 2.
Thus, Passing Qualifying Exams means to sit for an exam in the expected 
timeline and pass the exam.
