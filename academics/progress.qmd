Continued membership in the Statistics MS or PhD program and financial support 
(for graduate assistantships) from the department or a major professor are

At the end of every academic year each student will document their own progress 
by preparing a brief annual report of their coursework, 
research work in progress, exams, POS meetings, future goals, 
timeline for degree completion, professional activities, 
and provide an up-to-date curriculum vitae.
