# Progress

Continued membership in the Statistics MS or PhD program and financial support 
are contingent upon *Satisfactory Academic Progress* towards the degree.  

Satisfactory Academic Progress requires you to 

- Maintain a 3.0 Cumulative GPA

and complete a series of requirements in a timely manner.
These requirements include

- Successfully Complete Courses
- Pass Qualifying Exams
- Find a Major Professor
- Create an Academic Plan Committee
- Develop an Academic Plan
- Pass a Preliminary Exam
- Write a Creative Component or Dissertation
- Pass a Final Exam

At the end of every academic year each student will document their own progress 
by preparing a brief annual report of their coursework, 
research work in progress, exams, POS meetings, future goals, 
timeline for degree completion, professional activities, 
and provide an up-to-date curriculum vitae. 

Modifications to these requirements requires approval of the DOGE. 

## Maintain a 3.0 Cumulative GPA

Under [Chapter 5 - Courses, Credits, and Grading](https://www.grad-college.iastate.edu/handbook/chapter5-coursework)
in the Graduate Handbook, 
see the Probation and Academic Standing section.


## Successfully Complete Courses

The timelines provided for each degree provide the semesters when courses are
expected to be taken. 
The minimum grade acceptable for a course on the Academic Plan is a C. 
Thus, Successfully Complete Courses means to enroll and complete the courses
in the timelines given and receive a minimum of a C.


## Pass Qualifying Exams

The Department of Statistics has qualifying exams for its MS and PhD degrees. 
These are generally in-class exams given during summer break. 
The MS qualifying exam is taken after Year 1 
(after completion of STAT 500, 510, 542, and 543)
and the PhD qualifying exam is 
taken after Year 2 
(after completion of STAT 520, 601, 641, and 642).
Thus, Pass Qualifying Exams means to sit for an exam in the expected 
timeline and pass the exam. 

## Find a Major Professor

Upon completion of Pass Qualifying Exams (but possibly sooner),
the student should find a Major Professor. 
Typically, this is accomplished by viewing recent publications by faculty,
determining which publications are of interest to you, 
setting up meetings with faculty to discuss their research and needs,
and mutually agreeing with a faculty member that they are willing to be your
Major Professor.
