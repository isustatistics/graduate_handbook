As the program continues to evolve, as do the policies of the Graduate College, some of this information may be subject to change.\nStudents are expected to stay in close communication with their major professor, and bring any questions or concerns to the DOGE and Graduate Student Support Specialist regarding program requirements, policies, and other important issues.\nIn addition to this handbook, graduate students are expected to review and be familiar with the Graduate College Handbook. The Graduate College Handbook provides further details about university requirements, policies and procedures. There are frequent updates to this document, so make certain that you have the most recent version.",

    "text": "Welcome\nWelcome to the Statistics program!\nAs a graduate student in the Department of Statistics you have become an important part of this large and complex organization that includes faculty, students, and staff.\nThe Statistical Laboratory, which forms part of the department, was the first statistics unit created in the country. It dates from 1933 and is still in operation. The Department of Statistics was established in 1947 and it is housed in Snedecor Hall on the Iowa State University Campus in Ames, Iowa.\nWe are one of the largest departments of statistics in the nation (and in the world). As of today, we have about 30 faculty (depending on how you count) and 120 graduate students. During any one year, anywhere between 10 and 20 graduate students receive their PhD in Statistics. A primary mission of the Department and the Statistical Laboratory is the education and\nOur Graduate Program in Statistics is consistently in the Top 20 according to national rankings by the National Research Council and in the US News & World Report Graduate Program Rankings (although the value and accuracy of these rankings is highly debatable). Recent graduates from our program have gone on to work in industry (Amazon, Boeing, Disney, Google), national labs (NASA Jet Propulsion Lab, Los Alamos National Lab, Pacific Northwest National Lab), and academia (University of Nebraska-Lincoln, North Carolina State University, Carleton College).",

All students seeking the MS degree must complete the same set of core requirements.\n\n4.2.1 Prerequisites\nMultivariable calculus (at least three semesters of calculus in the U.S. system) and linear algebra are required background courses, and knowledge of this material is expected of students in the MS program. Applicants should have completed these or equivalent courses prior to application for admission.\n\n\n4.2.2 Requirements\nThe MS degree requires 34 credits including 18 credits in required courses, 2-4 credits of creative component research, and the remaining credits elective STAT courses at the 5000- or 6000-level. In addition to completing the required course credits, the student must pass a written exam. During or after the final semester of course work, students take an oral exam on work completed for the creative component (a capstone project).

This resulted in the following changes:\n\nCourse Renumbering\nWording Updates\nProcess Changes\nGraduate Handbook Update\n\n\n\n16.2.2 Course Renumbering\nAll courses at the university were converted from 3 digits to 4 digits by adding a 0 to the end of the course number, e.g. STAT 542 is now STAT 5420. It is expected that the Department will have a mass renumbering of courses soon to take advantage of the 4 digit numbers.\n\n\n16.2.3 Wording Updates\nMany of the terms used in graduate education at ISU have changed. Perhaps the two most important are\n\nProgram of Study (POS) -&gt; Academic Plan (AP)\nProgram of Study Committee (POSC) -&gt; Academic Plan Committee (APC)\n\n\n\n16.2.4 Graduate Handbook Update\nThe Graduate Handbook has been updated to reflect wording changes.\n\n\n16.2.5 Process Changes\nEssentially all student processes, e.g. registration, payroll, etc, are now in Workday.",
